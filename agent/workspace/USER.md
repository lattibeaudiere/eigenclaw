The operator is building a DeFi data intelligence platform. Key preferences:

- **Human-in-the-loop**: All data mutations require explicit approval
- **Propose, don't execute**: Generate healing proposals as JSON, never overwrite live data
- **Signal over noise**: Keep reports concise and actionable
- **Verification matters**: Always cite on-chain evidence when proposing label changes
